description: 'These were my New Experiences Working with Python'
---
This semester, I had the privilege to work with the application Python after having learned more in depth tools about RStudio. Throughout my college career, I had only coded in R, and learning a new language that was more widely known by a larger group of people was exciting to me, as with more practice, I'd be able to build up my coding language in one that is more readily available to others. One of the concepts I found to be most interesting about Python was my last homework assignment, where I had to code a function that would take two different sequences and count up their respective k-mers, which are usually seen as 3-mers (with three codons total), or k = 3.

Attached above is the sample of the coding used in the project. Being a STEM major, this is a concept that is very appealing to me, as it has applications in fields such as Genetics & Genomics, and Biotechnology.
