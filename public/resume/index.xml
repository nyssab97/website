      <description>#Education I am currently a 4th year senior at the University of Texas at Austin. Here, I am working to receive a Bachelors of Science and Arts (BSA Degree) in Biology, with a minor in Sociology. While being a student here, I have also taken at least one summer course every summer, whether it be from the UT Austin campus directly, or another college/university. I have also taken courses at the college campus that is closer to my hometown, which is called South Texas College.</description>
