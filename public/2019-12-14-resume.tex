\maketitle

I am currently a 4th year senior at the University of Texas at Austin.
Here, I am working to receive a Bachelors of Science and Arts (BSA
Degree) in Biology, with a minor in Sociology. While being a student
here, I have also taken at least one summer course every summer, whether
it be from the UT Austin campus directly, or another college/university.
I have also taken courses at the college campus that is closer to my
hometown, which is called South Texas College. Here, I took various
courses such as physics and government, which were credit transferred in
to UT Austin.

Some of my interests and hobbies include meditation, watching
television/movies, reading, shopping, dancing, singing, listening to
music, and coloring in a coloring book.

While in middle school and high school, I was able to get involved with
various volunteering experiences, such as a medical education (MedEd)
program that volunteered at a food bank, helping to plant trees with my
high school's LEOs Club, and volunteering at my local hospital in my
hometown, Doctor's Hospital at Renaissance. At UT Austin, I now have a
part-time job as a tutor/grader at a Kumon center.

While at UT I have been involved with many organizations, such as a
bible study through the Austin Stone Community Church, a Christian
sorority called Sigma Phi Lambda, and a national sorority called Sigma
Delta Tau. In the latter two organizations, I held various leadership
positions, such as a Prayer Group Leader and member in the first
sorority, and a Standards Board member in the second sorority. Within my
schooling experience, I was able to become Microsoft Office certified in
a previous edition, I was able to get CPR certified, and I am now able
to say I have been exposed to various coding languages R, LaTeX, and
Python.
